## Purpose :point_down:

I have made this brain trainer android application for people of any ages for checking their speed and attentiveness.

## Importance :point_down:

<div align="justified">

People of all ages use these games to improve mental functioning and prevent brain aging. Brain training may help improve your memory, response time, and logic skills, although research shows that the relationship between brain training games and improved cognitive function is complicated. Although brain games might not have the magical benefits you hoped for, they are not a total wash. Turns out, by playing a certain game over and over again, you are actually changing the way your brain works. “The benefits engendered by video game play are often the result of neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to modify its structure, chemistry, and function in response to a challenge."
